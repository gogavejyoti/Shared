We have successfully integrated the Gen AI chatbot into the Vertical Snapshot and Schedule Adherence modules. However, the current Gen AI license has some usage limitations. To address this, weâ€™ve reached out to the Platform Solutions team for support.

They have proposed a next course of action, tentatively planned for the first week of June. The primary objective of this initiative is to create a scalable framework that can integrate both existing and upcoming modules under the Gen AI umbrella. This includes enhanced features like report summarization and broader AI-powered insights.

Discussions are still ongoing, and we expect greater clarity by the second week of June. We will be in a position to share a more concrete timeline after that.
