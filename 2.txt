1. Summarize key insights in plain English.
2. Output the table in GitHub-flavored Markdown format:
   - First row = column names
   - Second row = alignment specifiers (e.g., |---:| for right alignment)
   - Each row = data
3. Format numbers with commas, and percentages with '%' symbol.
4. Do not output extra commentary after the table.
