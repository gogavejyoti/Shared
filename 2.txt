Overall Assessment:
Colombia’s sites show periods of critical shrinkage issues and inconsistent attrition spikes, especially near holiday weeks. Planned shrinkage is set flat across weeks and not aligned with recent actual variances, risking SLA compliance. Several LOBs enter staffing shortages or surpluses from 23-Nov-25 onward.

Alerts:
  • Staffing% remains high (119%+) through December, indicating overstaffing.
  • Shrinkage is planned uniformly (12%) despite actuals trending lower, particularly during holidays.
  • Attrition shows erratic peaks (4.13% actual, 1.25% planned), risking resource forecasting accuracy near year-end.
Recommendations:
  • Adjust shrinkage plans for holiday weeks to reflect actual lower shrinkage and reduce unnecessary buffers.
  • Revisit staffing levels post-23-Nov-25 to avoid overstaffing costs; align hiring and leave actions to real attrition patterns.
