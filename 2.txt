After exploring multiple use cases, we have identified one summarization approach that can be applied across several reports. As a starting point, we would like to implement this in our Vertical Snapshot report, which contains standard information such as Geo, Vertical, Account, LOB, FTE Required, FTE Available, Shrinkage, Attrition %, and Utilization.

Our goal is to enable AI-based summarization of user queries based on this SQL table. Once this module is in place, we plan to replicate the same approach for other reports in later phases.

Could you please guide us on how to proceed with the summarization part for this module? Any recommendations on architecture, tools, or implementation strategy would be highly valuable.
