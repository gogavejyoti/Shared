Subject: Update on Recent Visit to Chennai – Discussion on AI Integration in WFM

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I wanted to share a quick update following my recent visit to Chennai.

I had detailed discussions with Somesh (Business Analyst) and Prashant (AI Developer). Although I didn’t get a chance to meet Naushth in person, we connected over WebEx.

During the discussions, I provided a comprehensive walkthrough of our WFM portal and AI Assistant capabilities. I have requested their support in implementing AI-based summarization, prediction, and a configurable AI assistant for various reports.

While we are aiming for an API-based solution to integrate these AI features directly into the WFM portal, they are considering proposing a separate interface for AI functionality. I highlighted that using a separate interface would be less optimal, as it would:

Be treated as a separate application

Require users to leave the WFM portal each time they need AI outputs

Disrupt the user experience and create a fragmented workflow

In contrast, an API-based integration offers several key advantages:

Seamless user experience – all AI features are accessible within the WFM portal

Improved efficiency – no need to switch between applications

Consistent data flow – AI outputs can be directly linked to the existing WFM data and reports

Better adoption – users are more likely to use AI tools if they’re embedded in the platform they already use

Additionally, they have asked for a job code to purchase an AI subscription license specifically for the WFM module.

Please share your thoughts on both the integration approach and the license request.
