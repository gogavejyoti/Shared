To enhance the usability and analytical capabilities of the Vertical Snapshot Report by integrating AI-powered summarization, predictive analytics, and conversational insights using ChatGPT. This will empower stakeholders to interact with WFM metrics more intuitively and make data-driven decisions faster.

Currently, the Vertical Snapshot Report provides detailed WFM metrics across Vertical, Program, Geo, and LOB dimensions. However, users must manually interpret the data, which can be time-consuming and prone to oversight. There is no automated way to summarize trends, predict future outcomes, or interact with the data conversationally. Moreover, while users may contribute their own summaries, there is no intelligent system in place to synthesize these narratives with quantitative data. This results in fragmented insights, missed opportunities, and a lack of predictive foresight. The absence of automated summarization, trend detection, and conversational data interaction limits the report’s value as a strategic tool.

The goal of this project is to transform the existing Vertical Snapshot Report into an intelligent, AI-powered platform that delivers contextual, and predictive insights. By combining structured WFM metrics with user-provided summaries, the solution will generate optimal summarizations that enhance decision-making, reduce manual effort, and improve operational agility. Implement predictive analytics to forecast metrics like Shrinkage%, Attrition%, Staffing%, etc.



Responding to client queries in RFPs is a critical process for winning business. Currently, preparing responses is manual, time-consuming, and requires significant effort to ensure accuracy and professionalism. Leveraging AI can streamline this process, reduce turnaround time, and improve response quality, leading to higher client satisfaction and increased win rates.

The current RFP response process involves manually searching through historical Q&A datasets to craft answers. This approach is time-consuming, repetitive, and heavily dependent on individual expertise, which often leads to inconsistencies in tone, accuracy, and compliance. This is tedious and often delaying submissions and impacting quality. There is no automated mechanism to quickly retrieve contextually relevant answers and polish them for client-ready responses. Implementing an AI-powered assistant will address these challenges by streamlining the RFP response process, reducing turnaround time, improving consistency, and enhancing overall quality—leading to higher client satisfaction and improved win rates.

Implement an AI-powered assistant to:
Retrieve relevant answers from existing datasets.
Generate polished, context-appropriate responses.
Reduce RFP response preparation time by 60%.
Improve consistency and professionalism in client     communications.
Ensure all RFP responses are aligned with organizational standards, tone, and compliance requirements.
Create a centralized, searchable knowledge base for historical Q&A and best practices.
