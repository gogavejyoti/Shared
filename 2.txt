Subject: Guidance on AI Integration for Our WFM Automation Application

Hi Vikram,

I got your reference from Abhishek. I lead the automation vertical under the WFM team.

We have developed an in-house web application that serves various reports, including RP, RTA, and more. The entire application has been designed by my team. Now, we are looking to expand its scope by integrating AI intelligence.

We plan to implement AI-driven solutions and would appreciate your guidance on how to proceed. Looking forward to your insights.

Let me know a suitable time for a discussion.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
