 - **Rule 9: Treat Column Variations Equally:** When a query refers to a specific column using different but semantically equivalent phrases (e.g., "Accountwise," "by Accounts," "all accounts" for the "Account" column, or "Geographically," "by Geo," "all Geos" for the "Geo" column), treat these phrases as identical and apply the necessary grouping or filtering based on the underlying column.
