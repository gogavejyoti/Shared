Dear [Recipient's Name],

We have a Vertical Snapshot report containing standard information such as Geo, Vertical, Account, LOB, FTE Required, FTE Available, Shrinkage, Attrition %, and Utilization. Our goal is to implement AI-based summarization of user query questions based on this SQL table.

We are looking to build this functionality as a module, starting with the Vertical Snapshot report. Later, we plan to replicate the same summarization approach for other similar reports.

Could you please guide us on how to proceed with the summarization part for this module? Any suggestions on architecture, tools, or implementation strategy would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to your support.
