Assumptions:

Requests: 1,000 requests per day.
Input: 50 tokens per request (approximate conversion from 200 characters).
Output: 100 tokens per request (estimated SQL query length).

Gemini Flash Pricing:
Input: $0.075 per 1 million tokens.
Output: $0.30 per 1 million tokens.
Calculations:

Daily Token Usage:

Total tokens per request: 50 (input) + 100 (output) = 150 tokens.
Total daily tokens: 150 tokens/request * 1,000 requests/day = 150,000 tokens.
Daily Input Cost:

Input tokens per day: 50,000
(50,000/1,000,000) * $0.075 = $0.00375
Daily Output Cost:

Output tokens per day: 100,000
(100,000/1,000,000) * $0.30 = $0.03
Total Daily Cost:

$0.00375 + $0.03 = $0.03375
Monthly Cost (Approximate):

$0.03375/day * 30 days/month = $1.0125 per month.
Therefore, based on these assumptions, your approximate monthly cost would be around $1.01.
